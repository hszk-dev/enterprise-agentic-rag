Enterprise RAG Platform Documentation

This is a comprehensive guide to building production-ready
Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems for enterprise applications.

Chapter 1: Introduction

RAG combines the power of retrieval systems with large language models
to provide accurate, grounded responses. Unlike pure LLM approaches,
RAG systems can access up-to-date information and cite sources.

Key benefits of RAG:
- Reduced hallucinations through grounded retrieval
- Access to proprietary and current information
- Transparent source attribution
- Lower costs compared to fine-tuning

Chapter 2: Architecture

The system uses a clean architecture with distinct layers:

1. Domain Layer: Core business logic and entities
2. Application Layer: Use cases and orchestration
3. Infrastructure Layer: External service integrations
4. Presentation Layer: API endpoints

This separation of concerns enables:
- Independent testing of each layer
- Easy replacement of infrastructure components
- Clear dependency direction (inward only)

Chapter 3: Ingestion Pipeline

The ingestion pipeline processes documents through several stages:

1. Upload: Files are stored in object storage (MinIO/S3)
2. Parse: Documents are converted to plain text
3. Chunk: Text is split into searchable segments
4. Embed: Vector representations are generated
5. Index: Chunks are stored in the vector database

Error handling uses the Saga pattern with compensating transactions
to maintain data consistency across distributed storage systems.

Chapter 4: Search and Retrieval

Hybrid search combines dense and sparse retrieval:

- Dense vectors capture semantic similarity
- Sparse vectors (SPLADE) preserve keyword matching
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion merges results

Re-ranking with cross-encoders improves precision for top results.

Chapter 5: Generation

The generation phase constructs prompts with retrieved context
and generates responses using large language models.

Best practices:
- Include source citations in responses
- Set appropriate temperature (0 for factual queries)
- Implement fallback strategies for API failures
